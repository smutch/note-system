# Notes system

This is a completely personalised, horribly written vim plugin that is probably totally useless to anyone else.

However, this plugin manages my notes system and will likely evolve significantly over time in both features and quality.  Combined with [Marked 2](http://marked2app.com) and [Image Magick](http://www.imagemagick.org), I already find it to work well enough for my everyday use.
